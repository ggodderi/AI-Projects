# DECISIONS

Major project decisions will be recorded here.

- Engine: Python + Pygame for rapid development and cross-platform play.
- Testing: Core game logic separated into testable modules using pytest.
- Sounds: Use small synthesized tones via numpy + pygame.sndarray to avoid shipping large assets.
