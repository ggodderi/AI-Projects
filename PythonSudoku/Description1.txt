Please create a python program that will play sudoku puzzles.  It will do the following:
1 - Load random puzzles
2 - Provide a way for the user to click on a cell and enter a number
3 - It will inform the user if the number entered is incorrect, either because it is out side the range of 1-9 or if the number is already used in the associated row, column, or region.
4 - It will provide the user a hint button that will tell the user what the options are for any given cell.
5 - When all cells are filled, it will tell the user if the puzzle is correct or not.

As stated, please use Python and an appropriate graphics module to create this gui program.

place the python program in the file: ai_sudoku1.py
